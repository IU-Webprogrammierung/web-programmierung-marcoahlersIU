      <h1>Enhancing Corporate Transparency: Hinweisgeber.in</h1>

      <p>
        As a key developer on the Hinweisgeber.in project at Gridventures GmbH,
        I was tasked with addressing the critical need for an internal reporting
        system compliant with legal requirements for entities with 50 or more
        employees. My responsibilities encompassed the full spectrum of
        development tasks, from conceptualizing the user interface with React
        and Shadcn UI to engineering a dependable backend using Node.js and
        Postgres.

      <p>
        This project was not only a technical challenge but also a meaningful
        opportunity to contribute to a platform that promotes integrity and
        accountability within organizations. My involvement ranged from coding
        and testing to deploying the system, ensuring a user-friendly experience
        while maintaining the highest standards of security and privacy for
        sensitive reports.
