        <h1>Enhancing Corporate Transparency: Hinweisgeber.in</h1>

        <p>
          As a key developer on the Hinweisgeber.in project at Gridventures
          GmbH, I was tasked with addressing the critical need for an internal
          reporting system compliant with legal requirements for entities with
          50 or more employees. My responsibilities encompassed the full
          spectrum of development tasks, from conceptualizing the user interface
          with React and Shadcn UI to engineering a dependable backend using
          Node.js and Postgres.

        <p>
          This project was not only a technical challenge but also a meaningful
          opportunity to contribute to a platform that promotes integrity and
          accountability within organizations. My involvement ranged from coding
          and testing to deploying the system, ensuring a user-friendly
          experience while maintaining the highest standards of security and
          privacy for sensitive reports.
