# Enhancing Corporate Transparency: Hinweisgeber.in

As a key developer on the Hinweisgeber.in project at Gridventures
GmbH, I was tasked with addressing the critical need for an internal
reporting system compliant with legal requirements for entities with
50 or more employees. My responsibilities encompassed the full
spectrum of development tasks, from conceptualizing the user interface
with React and Shadcn UI to engineering a dependable backend using
Node.js and Postgres.

This project was not only a technical challenge but also a meaningful
opportunity to contribute to a platform that promotes integrity and
accountability within organizations. My involvement ranged from coding
and testing to deploying the system, ensuring a user-friendly
experience while maintaining the highest standards of security and
privacy for sensitive reports.
